# Yeoman / Ember Basic Example

A very primitive example of an Ember.js app managed by Yeoman.

## Getting started

Install required plugin:

```
$ npm install grunt-ember-templates
```

Precompile templates (this step won't be necessary after [some issues](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/595) are resolved in yeoman):

```
$ yeoman ember_templates
```

Fire up the server:

```
$ yeoman server
```

## Next steps

I'd like to add dependency management with minispade.

I'd also like to extract some of the patterns from this example into yeoman generators.
